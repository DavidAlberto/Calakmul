## Data

### Shotgun

The Shotgun metagenomic data can be downloaded from the [MG-RAST](https://www.mg-rast.org/mgmain.html?mgpage=project&project=55d11f3ab66d6770313033343737) page. 

### Metabarcoding

The metarbarcoding metagenomic data can be downloaded from the [SRA]() page.

## Data analysis

This analysis can be found in the following link [Calakmul](Calakmul/Calakmul.Rmd).

### Run script

To run the script it is necessary to download the data and place them in separate folders, the shotgun data and the metabarcoding data.

## Software and packages

The version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) used is 4.2.2 and the version of the packages is included in the script in Session information.
